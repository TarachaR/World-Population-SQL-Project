Project Goals:

I was working with a dataset of world population by country data from recent years. 

Wrote queries to retrieve interesting data and answer a set of specific questions.

Project Requirements:
2. In this project, I answered questions using a database of world population by country.

The schema of the database is:

Column		          Type		    Notes
country		          STRING	
population	        NUMBER		(in millions)
year		            NUMBER	

Refer to this schema as you write queries to the database.

When you finish this project, you should be able to answer each the questions that follow using a single SQL query.

1.What years are covered by the dataset? (you can manually count the number of years returned).

2. What is the largest population size for Gabon in this dataset?

3. What were the 10 lowest population countries in 2005?

4. What are all the distinct countries with a population of over 100 million in the year 2010?

5. How many countries in this dataset have the word “Islands” in their name?

6. What is the difference in population between 2000 and 2010 in Indonesia?
